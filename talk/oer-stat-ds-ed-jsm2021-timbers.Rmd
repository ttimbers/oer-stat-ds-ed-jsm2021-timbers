### Why create and use open educational resources in general?

- cost savings for learners üí∏

- quick iteration and extension on materials for instructors ‚ôªÔ∏è + üèóÔ∏è

- and raising the quality of the resources by facilitating collaboration üë•üë•üë•

- your teaching materials (and pedagogies) become more discoverable üîç

### Why create and use open educational resources in data science?

***All the reasons I just stated, and...***



***... it mirrors the practices, tools and workflows used when practising data science***.

### Example of OER's we have built using Data Science Open Source tools


1. [*Data Science: A First Introduction*](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/) - an open textbook aimed at undergraduates students taking their first course in data science

2. [Syllabi, lecture notes, labs and lecture videos from courses for a professional Master's in Data Science program](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public)

3. [Key Capabilities in Data Science online courses](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/programs/key-capabilities-data-science) - Interactive online learning modules aimed at mid-career learners

### Lessons learned from building, sharing and maintaining data science OER's

- don't do it alone

- don't be afraid to share

- use a license

- maintenance is needed to keep material current

- OER's which need interactive computation require money or infrastructure to share

---

### Impact of OER's
